# HedgeNet

HedgeNet is a simple password management application for Windows based PCs. The application is designed for random generation, secure storage and easy access to passwords through a simple user interface (UI).

## Demo

## Requirements

 - A desktop platform that can compile .NET Core 3.1. I recommend using Visual Studio Community Edition (Windows), Visual Studio for Mac (macOS) or MonoDevelop (Linux), all of which are free.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository  (`git clone https://github.com/komarowski/HedgeNet.git`)
- Build in your IDE of choice (recommended IDEs automatically restore nuget packages; if you are using an alternative make sure to `nuget restore`)

## Contributing

Contributions will not be accepted for the project at this time.
